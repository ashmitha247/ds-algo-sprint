# Greedy Algorithms

## Overview
Greedy algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit. The greedy choice is made with the hope that it will lead to a globally optimal solution.

## Key Characteristics
- **Local Optimum**: Makes the best choice at each step
- **No Backtracking**: Once a choice is made, it's never reconsidered
- **Efficient**: Often runs in polynomial time
- **Not Always Optimal**: Works only when the greedy choice property holds

## When to Use Greedy Algorithms
1. Problem exhibits optimal substructure
2. Greedy choice property is satisfied
3. No need to reconsider previous choices

## Common Applications
- Activity Selection
- Huffman Coding
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal's, Prim's)
- Fractional Knapsack
- Job Scheduling

## Topics Covered
- **Target Minimization Patterns**: Strategies for minimizing differences, costs, or distances to target values
