# Cluster 04: Hashing & Frequency
**Tier 2: Logic** - Using hash maps for frequency counting

## Pattern Overview
Leverage hash tables to solve problems involving frequency counting, finding duplicates, and element grouping.

## CodeChef Practice Problems
- `Majority_Element` - Find element appearing more than n/2 times
- `Single_Number` - Find the unique element
- `Anagrams` - Check if two strings are anagrams

## LeetCode Revision
- [LC 169](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) - Majority Element
- [LC 136](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/) - Single Number
- [LC 242](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) - Valid Anagram

## Key Concepts
- Hash maps/dictionaries
- Frequency arrays
- O(1) lookup time
- Space-time tradeoffs
- Time Complexity: O(n), Space: O(n)
