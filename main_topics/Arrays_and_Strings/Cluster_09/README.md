# Cluster 09: Sorting & Intervals
**Tier 3: Teach** - Interval manipulation and sorting applications

## Pattern Overview
Solve problems involving intervals, merging ranges, and sorting-based optimizations.

## CodeChef Practice Problems
- `Merge_Intervals` - Merge overlapping intervals
- `Stock_Profits` - Best time to buy/sell stock

## LeetCode Revision
- [LC 56](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/) - Merge Intervals
- [LC 88](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/) - Merge Sorted Array

## Key Concepts
- Interval representation [start, end]
- Sorting by start/end times
- Merging overlapping ranges
- In-place merging
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) for sorting

## Advanced Patterns
- Greedy approaches
- Two-pointer merging
- Event-based processing
