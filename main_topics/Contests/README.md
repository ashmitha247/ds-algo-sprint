# Contests Archive

This section tracks performance during live competitive programming events and mock assessments.

## Purpose

- **Apply learned patterns under time pressure**
- **Identify gaps in knowledge**
- **Map problems back to existing clusters**
- **Create new clusters for novel patterns**

## Structure

Each contest gets its own dated folder:
```
Contest_Name_YYYY-MM-DD/
├── problem1.py
├── problem2.py
├── problem3.py
└── analysis.md
```

## Post-Contest Analysis

After every contest:
1. Review each problem
2. Map to existing cluster (if applicable)
3. Identify what went wrong (logic/implementation/time)
4. Create new cluster if pattern is novel
5. Document lessons learned

*The goal is not just to participate, but to extract maximum learning from every competitive experience.*
